Analytics Vidhya Capillary ML Hackathon

This solution was created using:
* R (3.3.1)
* data.table package (1.10.0)
* _Most other versions of R and data.table will also work_

The solution was created on the following system:
* Macbook Pro
* Processor: i7
* Memory: 16GB DDR3
* _the solution can be created on much less hardware_

Input files:
* train file: train.csv
* test file: test_nFNPSyV.csv
* sample submission: sample_submission_qfCnaKZ.csv
* _no other files were used to create the submission_
* _The directory used to specifically create this solution is within the code (Line2); change accordingly_ 

To run:
* execute `sub3.R` from preferred R environment
* it executes completely in about 3 seconds in the environment described above

Outputs:
* sub3_updatedDate.csv
* _will output in the location set in Line2_
